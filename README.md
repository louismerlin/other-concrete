## What is this ?

This a classless CSS stylesheet, built for lightness and simplicity.

Concrete can be a great starting point for a simple website.

It also switches to a dark theme if your OS uses one.
 
Best used in pair with [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

Inspired by [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).
